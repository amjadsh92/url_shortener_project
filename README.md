# Project Title

URL Shortener APP

# Project Description

The main goal of this app is to shorten a long URL into a short one.
Guest users would get an auto generated short URL. Members (registered users) on the other hand can create their own short URLs. 
Members have also a table in their home page that contains all their short URLS with the associated original URLs.
